## üîÑ Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection  
- Student survey data from Trent University's Careerspace.  
- Contained responses on **satisfaction** and **service awareness**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicates & missing values.  
- Standardized text formats (case, spelling, categories).  
- Used Excel, Python, and Power Query for cleaning.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas & SQL.  
- Segmented results by **faculty, year of study, and awareness levels**.  
- Conducted correlation analysis to find relationships between satisfaction and awareness.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization  
- Built **Tableau dashboards** to compare satisfaction across groups.  
- Created charts in Python (Seaborn/Matplotlib) for statistical analysis.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling  
- Applied Logistic Regression to predict likelihood of high satisfaction.  
- Used Decision Trees to identify factors most influencing awareness.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Key Findings  
‚úÖ **68%** of students were unaware of certain key resources.  
‚úÖ Higher awareness strongly correlated with higher satisfaction scores.  
‚úÖ Recommended targeted outreach campaigns to boost awareness.
